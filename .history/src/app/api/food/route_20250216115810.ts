It looks like you have a basic CRUD API for managing food items. What would you like to do next? Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Add validation**: Ensure that the `name` and `calories` fields are provided and valid.
2. **Persist data**: Store the food items in a database instead of in-memory.
3. **Add error handling**: Improve error handling for better user feedback.
4. **Add authentication**: Secure your API endpoints.

Please let me know which direction you'd like to take or if you have any other specific requirements.
